You are an AI assistant helping build a WMS diploma project.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose)
- Maps: Google Maps or Mapbox
- Auth: JWT
- State management: lightweight (Zustand or React Context)
- AI features are mocked initially (fake data allowed)

Rules:
- Write clean, readable, production-like code
- Prefer simple solutions over overengineering
- Use TypeScript everywhere
- Use REST API (not GraphQL)
- UI should be minimal and modern
- Fake data is acceptable for MVP
- Comment complex logic briefly
